# Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this repository, I want to implement those most amazing deep reinforcement learning models. Hope one day, you can see a strong AI model here:)

## Attention model

No one can ingore a model who combine recurrent network, convolutional network and reinforcement learning together. And it is the attention model. According to Mnih's paper[1],   
Until now, I implement two fancy deep reinforcement learning models, DQN and Attention model.
