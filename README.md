# Deep Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of two early-stage DRL models.

## DQN

In this repository, I implement DQN to teach the AI outperfom the computer in Pong game.

## Attention model

According to Mnih's paper[2], recurrent attention model can focus on part of a image to extract the most useful information which can help action layer take an right action.
