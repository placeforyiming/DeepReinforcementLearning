# Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this repository, I want to implement those most amazing deep reinforcement learning models. Hope one day, you can see a strong AI model here:)

## DQN

DQN is the first model which make us believe deep reinforcement learning can work[1]. From that time, deep reinforcement learning develop very fast and become the key role to help AlphaGo beat top human.

In this repository, I implement DQN to teach the AI beat the computer in Pong game.

## Attention model

No one can ingore a model who combine recurrent network, convolutional network and reinforcement learning together. According to Mnih's paper[2], recurrent attention model can finally focus on part of a image to extract the most useful information which can help action layer take an action.
